#### Modern Minimal Style Portfolio

####  Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually, yes(with attribution)

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, **plagiarism is bad**. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

#### Credit

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [maksklauss@hotmail.com]. Thanks!
